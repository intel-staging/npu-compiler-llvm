# This file lists reviewers that are auto-assigned when a pull request modifies
# certain files or directories. If you add yourself to this file, you commit to
# reviewing a large fraction of pull requests in the relevant area.
#
# The GitHub "code owners" mechanism is used exclusively to auto-assign
# reviewers and does not carry significance beyond that. It is not necessary
# to receive an approval from a "code owner" in particular -- any LLVM project
# member can approve pull requests.
#
# This is independent of LLVM's own "maintainer" concept.
# See https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#maintainers as well as the
# Maintainers.* files in the the respective subproject directories.
